Particle simulation softwares
------------------------------
`LIGGGHTS <https://www.cfdem.com/liggghts-open-source-discrete-element-method-particle-simulation-code>`_: a general granular and granular heat transfer simulator based on LAMMPS. It can be coupled with CFD to simulate fluid-solid systems (very cool).

`ESyS-Particle <https://launchpad.net/esys-particle>`_: an Open Source software for particle-based numerical modelling. Not only granular flows, it can be used to simulate rock fragmentation and fault gouge evolution.

`REBOUND <https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_: an N-body integrator that can integrate the motion of particles under the influence of gravity. It has various integrators and gravity solvers.

`PKDGrav <http://faculty.washington.edu/trq/hpcc/faculty/trq/brandon/pkdgrav.html>`_: a parallel N-body tree code. Prof. Richardson and Dr. Michel's group added collisional physics to the code so it could be applied to problems in planetary science.


Visualisation Tools
----------------------------
`ParaView <https://www.paraview.org/>`_: an open-source multiple-platform application for interactive, scientific visualization.

`POV-Ray <http://www.povray.org/>`_: a cross-platform ray-tracing program that generates images from a text-based scene description.

`VTK <https://vtk.org/>`_: an open-source software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing and scientific visualization.


Selected small body missions
----------------------------
`MMX <http://mmx.isas.jaxa.jp/en/>`_ mission to Martian moons Phobos and Deimos. 

`DART <https://dart.jhuapl.edu/>`_ and `Hera <https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Hera>`_ missions to impact and explore Didymos system.

`OSIRIS-REx <https://www.asteroidmission.org/>`_ asteroid sample return mission to Bennu.

`Hayabusa2 <https://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/>`_ asteroid sample return mission to Ryugu.

`Rosetta <https://sci.esa.int/web/rosetta>`_ mission to land on and fly with 67P.

`Hayabusa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa>`_ asteroid sample return mission to Itokawa.
