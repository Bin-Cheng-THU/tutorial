Structure
----------------------

`Data`: storage for data files including point data, wall data, biDisperse data and so on.

`src`: source codes of DEMBody.

`Input`: input files including systemControl.dembody, input_points.txt, bondedWallPoint.vtk, trimeshWall.mesh, bondedTriMeshWall.mesh, largeParticles.bidisperse, gravTriMesh.force (depends on which modules you use).

`build`: target program and temperory files generated by `Cmake <https://cmake.org/>`_.

`docs`: documentations generated by `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_.

`legancy`: abandoned files.


Pre-/Post-process
------------------

We developed `DEMTool <https://github.com/Bin-Cheng-THU/DEMTool.git>`_ for pre- and post-process for DEMBody, e.g., point/mesh file generation and data rending based on `POV-Ray <http://www.povray.org/>`_ . It is a standalone package whose output files can be easily imported into most commercial and Open Source DEM software. Please read the instruction in `DEMTool <https://github.com/Bin-Cheng-THU/DEMTool.git>`_ for details.
